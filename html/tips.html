        <h2>Fishing Tips</h2>
	<div class="container">
		<div class="row">
			<h2>Walleye</h2>
			<p>To begin fishing for Walleye, it's recommended that you invest in a sturdy spinning combo. A Medium Power 6-7 Ft. 
        spinning rod and a medium-sized 35 reel are versatile enough to handle most of the popular Walleye fishing techniques. However, 
        if you're planning to use more subtle tactics such as jigging or rigging live bait, a Medium Light power rod would be a better option. 
        Having both types of rods at your disposal would allow you to effortlessly switch between the two approaches. 
        You can use the Medium Power rod for artificial methods like Crankbaits and Soft Plastics, and the Medium Light power rod for live bait.</p>
        <h2>Power - 4/10</h2>

        </div>

			<h2>Muskellunge</h2>
			<p>When it comes to Musky fishing, you'll need specialized equipment that can handle their size and strength. A heavy-duty 
        baitcasting combo is recommended, with a Heavy Power 7-8 Ft. rod and a large 300-size reel. This combo will allow you to cast large, 
        heavy lures that are often used for Musky fishing, and provide enough backbone to handle their hard strikes and long fights. You may also 
        want to consider investing in a good quality braided line, which can handle the weight and strength of these fish. Overall, it's important 
        to have the right gear when Musky fishing, as it can make the difference between landing that trophy fish or going home empty-handed.</p>
        <h2>Power - 9/10</h2>
        <div class="power-bar">
          <div class="fight-intensity muskellunge"></div>
        </div>
      </div>
    <div class="row">
      <h2>Bass</h2>
			<p>For Bass fishing, a Medium-Light to Medium Power 6-7 Ft. spinning rod and reel combo is ideal for a variety of techniques such as 
        jigging, drop shotting, and casting. If you're planning to fish in heavy cover, a Medium-Heavy Power rod would be a better option to 
        avoid getting stuck in weeds or other debris. Additionally, if you're fishing for larger Bass species like Largemouth, a Heavy Power 
        rod would be a better option to handle the fight and prevent the fish from breaking your line.</p>
        <h2>Power - 7/10</h2>
        <div class="power-bar">
          <div class="fight-intensity bass"></div>
        </div>
      </div>
    <div class="row">
			<h2>Trout</h2>
			<p>To catch Trout, a Light Power 6-7 Ft. spinning rod and reel combo is recommended. This type of rod will allow you to cast small lures
        and bait with ease, while also providing enough sensitivity to feel for bites. Light power rods are also flexible, making it easier to
        handle sudden movements and prevent the fish from breaking the line. If you're fishing for larger Trout species like Steelhead, a Medium
        Power rod may be necessary to handle the fish's fighting power. These fish can put up a strong fight, so having a rod with more backbone will
        help you reel them in without snapping your line. With a Medium Power rod, you'll be able to use larger lures and bait, giving you more options
        when it comes to fishing techniques.
        </p>
        <h2>Power - 5/10</h2>
        <div class="power-bar">

    <!--<div class="row">
			<h2>Salmon</h2>
			<p>Salmon fishing requires a strong and sturdy setup to handle the fight of these hard-fighting fish. A Medium-Heavy Power 8-9 Ft. 
        rod and a large-sized reel with a strong drag system are recommended for salmon fishing. This combination provides the necessary backbone 
        to handle the weight and power of the salmon while also being flexible enough to make long casts. When fishing for salmon, it's important to 
        choose the right lure or bait. Some popular options include spoons, spinners, and plugs. It's also important to pay attention to the water 
        conditions and the time of day you're fishing, as these factors can impact the success of your fishing trip.
