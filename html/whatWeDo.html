            At Brothers Bait, our reputation precedes us for our exceptional
            ability to catch large fish. Our expertise lies in a select few
            species, including Musky, Walleye, Smallmouth, Trout, and Salmon. As
            we fish daily, we stay updated on the latest hot bait and prime
            locations. Our confidence in our products leads us to exclusively
            use our own baits and rods. We go beyond simply guiding our
            customers by teaching them how to use our gear and offering advice
            on when to use certain items. Despite being a small operation run by
            two brothers, we are capable of taking both single individuals and
            large groups on our guided fishing trips. To showcase our fishing
            adventures, we maintain an active presence on Instagram and
            Facebook. Our services are available year-round, ensuring that you
            can book us anytime.
